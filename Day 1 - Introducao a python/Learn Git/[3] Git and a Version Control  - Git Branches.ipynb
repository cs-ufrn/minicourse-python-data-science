    "# 1. Introduction To Git Branches\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may recall from the last notebook, it's very common for large teams to use Git. That's because Git enables smooth collaboration between many programmers who are all making changes to a repo at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even so, this type of situation makes it difficult for everyone to work off of the master branch. To understand why, let's imagine that we start out with two files, <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">bot.py</span> and <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">README.md</span>:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img width=\"300\" alt=\"creating a repo\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=0BxhVm1REqwr0TDA5S0JEZnNFZkk\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have three people working on a team -- <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">Seashell Sally</span>, <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">Rocky Raccoon</span>, and <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">Superman</span>. Each person makes the following changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img width=\"300\" alt=\"creating a repo\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=0BxhVm1REqwr0d2N4bUhJakxXV3M\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Each person commits their changes. Because they're all working on the master branch, the commit history will end up looking like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img width=\"500\" alt=\"creating a repo\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=0BxhVm1REqwr0R3RZWlJaYjRZa0U\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the most recent commit is different for each person. What's even worse is that all of the commits make changes to the same files. There's no way for Git to determine which changes are the \"correct\" ones, so the team members will have issues if they all try to push to the remote. Let's see what happens when Superman pushes his changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img width=\"500\" alt=\"creating a repo\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=0BxhVm1REqwr0V0FHczhJOGhzaGM\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now Rocky and Sally can't push to the remote, because commits <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">456</span> and <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">765</span> conflict with Superman's commit <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">b53</span>. Rocky, Sally, and Superman edited the same lines in the same files. This results in something called a merge conflict, which is painful to fix, and something we'll talk about in the next mission.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, Git gives us a few ways to avoid merge conflicts. The best method involves using branches. Similar to the way tree branches diverge from the trunk, Git branches allow us to create several different work areas within the same repo. It's common to create a new branch whenever we want to make a change to a project, and then merge that branch back into the master branch when we're done.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example where Superman, Rocky, and Sally each make their own branches:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img width=\"700\" alt=\"creating a repo\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=0BxhVm1REqwr0bk50bUZnZWFsaWM\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of them originally pulled the master branch, which has the commit <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">f34</span>. Then they created separate branches; Superman created <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">enhancement</span>, Rocky created <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">rocky</span>, and Sally created <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">shells</span>. They each made a commit on their own branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "When each person pushes their branch to the remote, Git stores it separately so that it doesn't conflict with everyone else's changes. Afterwards, the remote will have the branches <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">master</span>, <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">enhancement</span>, <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">rocky</span>, and <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">shells</span>. While the team will eventually want to merge all of the branches into master, using branches allows them to make changes to the repo separately while avoiding conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also other benefits to using branches. Imagine that Sally wants to make <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">10</span> more commits before merging, and Rocky wants to make <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">2</span>. Working on different branches will make their software development process go much faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can create a branch with the [git branch](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-branch) command. For example, <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">git branch rocky</span> will create a branch called <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">rocky</span>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Afterwards, we can switch to the new branch using the [git checkout](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout) command. To do this, we'd type <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">git checkout rocky</span>. Alternatively, we can create a shortcut by combining the two commands with <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">git checkout -b rocky</span>. This will create a branch named <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">rocky</span> and then switch to it right away, without our having to type a second, separate command.\n",
