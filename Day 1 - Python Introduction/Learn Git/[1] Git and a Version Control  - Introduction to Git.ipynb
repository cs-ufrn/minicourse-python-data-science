    "When you're working on a team, everyone will generally be making changes to the same files. Imagine you're working on a project to write a Python script, and have a folder with the following two files:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\" style=\"background-color:#F9F9F9; border: 0px\">\n",
    "<b>script.py</b>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<b>README.md</b>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the contents of <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">script.py</span>:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">```python\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    print(\"Welcome to a script!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that you and a coworker are both working on the project at the same time. You modify <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">script.py</span> like this:\n",
    "\n",
    ">```python\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    print(\"Welcome to a script!\")\n",
    "    print(\"Here's my amazing contribution to this project!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And your coworker does this:\n",
    "\n",
    ">```python\n",
    "import math\n",
    "print(10 + 10)\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    print(\"Welcome to a script!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that you both have the folder on your local machine. To modify files, you make changes, then upload the entire folder to a centralized location like Dropbox or Google Drive to enable collaboration. If you didn't have a distributed version control system, whoever changed the file last would overwrite the changes of the other person.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach becomes extremely frustrating and impossible to manage as you start dealing with larger and larger chunks of code. What if the folder had 100 files, you modified 10 of them, and your coworker modified 30 at the same time? You don't want to lose your changes every time your coworker uploads his version of the folder. Now, imagine that instead of just you and a coworker, it's a project with 10 or 100 contributors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Companies face this problem every day, which is why distributed **version control** systems exist. These systems will \"merge\" changes together intelligently, enabling multiple developers to work on a project at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going back to the <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">script.py</span> file, if we intelligently merged the two versions, the end result would look like this:\n",

    "import math\n",
    "print(10 + 10)\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    print(\"Welcome to a script!\")\n",
    "    print(\"Here's my amazing contribution to this project!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few distributed version control systems, including [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/) and [Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org/). [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is by far the most popular, however.\n",

    "- Navigate to the [Git downloads page](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and download the appropriate installer for your operating system.\n",

    "# 3. Creating Files In The Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical Git workflow involves adding files, making changes, and then storing a checkpoint (or \"snapshot\") of those changes. These checkpoints are called <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">commits</span>. Instead of storing every file in every commit, Git stores the <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">diff</span>, or the things that change between commits.\n",
